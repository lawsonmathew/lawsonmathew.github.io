        <p class="bio"> As a first generation student, born and raised in India for the first nine years of my life,
            I have had to grasp at the opportunities available to be where I was today. The most important opportunity was in high school, when I had the
            support of the Schuler Scholar Program. They helped enrich my life with opportunities for exposure and
            access to events I would never have had. </p>
        
        <img src="spurs.png" id="spurs"/>
        <p class="bio"> Since my education in the U.S. started, my hobbies have become more technology related. They include working with image
            manipulation softwares, video
            editing, animation, coding, and keeping up with current news, usually sports and world news. I am an avid fan of Tottenham Hotspur soccer team, a general sports enthusiast, and also like to cook.
        </p>
        
        
        <p class="bio"> Currently studying at Tufts University, I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer
            Science. I studied abroad at University College London during my junior year focusing on Mechanical Engineering courses. </p>
        
        <p class="bio"> My current goal is to get an entry level job as a Mechanical Engineer to gain experience in the field. I want to continue learning more about the sciences especially the fields of astrophysics and astronomy in order to further
            my career as a Mechanical Engineer working to discover, innovate, and excite. </p>
