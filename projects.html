            <p class="projP" style="text-align:center; font-style: italic; font-size: 11pt;"> Final design and layout</p>

            <p class="projP"> 
                In my senior design class at Tufts University, I worked on a semester long project to help a client with their problem. The problem was to show the feasability of the Tufts sonic anemometer, a windspeed measuring instrument, at a high altitude environment by building a balloon payload that will store the data from the anemometer to an SD card for analysis when recovered. In order to make sense of the anemometer data, storing the output of a variety of sensors like temperature, pressure, GPS, and magnetometer with a synced clock was necessary. Furthermore, we had to building an insulating enclosure for the electronics as well as a mount for the anemometer. 
            </p>

            <p class="projP">
                I was leading the group making sure that all the deadlines were met, meetings were scheduled, and all parts of the project were coming together. I focused on programming all the sensors to store its data to an sd card on the Raspberry Pi Zero W and assembly of the whole project. The following paragraph describes the timeline of events during the semester in which all the group members helped to complete.
            </p>
            <p class="projP">
                Initially, we started with some concept generation like using morphology tables and a systems diagram and then moved on to finalizing a components list which included batteries to use. After buying electronic parts, decisions about materials and final designs of the enclosure and mount were made. One of the main objectives was that the whole payload had to weigh under 5 pounds and was successfully achieved. Data logging validation was completed as well. In the end, we did a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AIuYB0diWo8ez9ve4bSv-uJyAcmR6iqB/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> <strong> poster presentation </strong> </a> to show of our final prototype and handed over our project for the client to use.

            <p class="projP" style="text-align:center; font-style: italic; font-size: 11pt;"> CAD model and final prototype</p>

            <p class="projP"> 
                During my study abroad at University College London, I participated in a group project where a squash ball launcher had to be fabricated. It was built considering the IMechE Line Launcher Challenge rules of which the main purpose was to have an automated line launcher which fired at targets of three different heights. 
            </p>
            <p class="projP"> 
                I led the team by organizing meetings and helping to assign parts to be completed by the members of the group. The year long project was split into two parts, one was creating the final design and the second was the assembly of the launcher. I worked on some parts of the CAD modelling using CATIA as well as the assembly of the automated launcher. This was my first exposure to the Arduino and other microcontrollers so my computer science experience helped with the programming of the motors and general function. I also gained more experience with laser cutting and 3D printing during this project. 
            </p>
            <p class="projP"> 
                The final prototype worked effectively at launching the ball but didn't achieve the goal of hitting the targets. But through this project, I embraced becoming a leader and worked on those skills. I also gained technical knowledge and was able to put my engineering skills to create a product from scratch.

            </div>

            <p class="projP">
                During my graphic arts course, I decided to make this animation for a presentation on moon formation theories 
                and the fission theory stuck out to me. I made this animation to show what the fission theory was and what happened to 
                the earth and moon during it. Using Autodesk 3ds Max and a video editing software, I modeled and rendered the animation. 
            </p>

            <p class="projP">
               What I learned from my previous encounters with 3D modeling softwares was the difficulty of working with different 
               perspectives and that project of this size is arduous. I improved on my skills of working with 3D modeling softwares 
               as I worked on this project. The animation didn't end up looking like how it did in my head, but I was able to create
               different parts of the simulation with the help of set ideas that it needed to fulfill. The overall experience was 
               fulfilling because I was able to come up with a good end product.

            <p class="projP"> I, along with my fellow members in the Tech Genius club at my highschool, worked with the Teen Lab at the Shedd Aquarium
                to make a virtual reality tour for the Amazon Rising Exhibit. This project took over a semester and we used a 360 camera 
                to make this work. I spent most of the time with helping with ideation and the organization of the project, and working on 
                the scripts for the commentary in the videos. 
            </p>

            <p class="projP"> I learned a lot about teamwork and how I fit into teamworking situations. There was also some 
                presentations that was done to showcase our project, which helped me become a better public speaker. The overall project helped 
                me build better connections with others and improve upon the skills I had and wanted to develop further.

                Another project I took on with the help of my graphic arts teacher during high school,
                was the branding project for my high school. This project took a year and half to complete. 
                Our client was the principal of the high school and his inputs were the main feedback my team and I got. 
                These logo images above represent some of the work that done during the project using Adobe Illustrator. Colors were a
                crucial component of this project since print and screen colors were different shades of a general color. Click <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6BHt40odk2JYTFwZHc2SThCREU" target="_blank"> <strong> here </strong> </a>
                to see all the different print and screen logos made for the branding. 
            </p>

            <p class="projP">
                I learned a lot about working with clients and how I can work in team for a project of this size. I learned a lot about 
                graphic design, including its main principles, and the modern world trends in logo design and branding.
